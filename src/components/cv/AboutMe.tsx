              Hi, and welcome to my personal page! I'm Leandro, originally from
              Limeira — a not-so-small city in the countryside of São Paulo,
              Brazil. I'm currently a PhD student in the QUEX joint program,
              working at the intersection of Physics and Computer Science. My
              research lies in the multidisciplinary field of Optical Computing,
              where I explore how light can be harnessed to perform machine
              learning tasks, accelerate processing, reduce energy consumption
              during training and inference, and more.

              I love traveling and discovering new places. But more than that, I
              value the connections made along the way — it's the people who
              make the journey meaningful. Feel free to reach out if you'd like
              to connect, collaborate, or just have a good chat!
